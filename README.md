# Car Park Tech Test #

Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles

Goals:
- Your solution should be in Java.

Assumptions:
- The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
- The parking lot has motorcycle spots and car spots spots
- A motorcycle can park in a motorcycle spot OR a regular spot
- A car can park in a regular spot
- A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots
- These are just a few assumptions. Feel free to ask your interviewer about more assumptions as needed

Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:
- Tell us how many spots are remaining
- Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot
- Tell us when the parking lot is full
- Tell us when the parking lot is empty
- Tell us when certain spots are full e.g. when all motorcycle spots are taken
- Tell us how many spots vans are taking up

# Suggestions for Classes #

At a very minimum we expect to see:

- Vehicle Class 
- Motorcycle Class
- Car Class
- Van Class
- Car Park Class
- A method to populate the car park
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

**A solution**

- Run the code using Main class.
- After each parking attempt general stats about car park are logged.
- At moment no cars leave the car park!
